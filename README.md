## Project Implementation

### Models and Their Relationships

- **Account**: Represents a bank account with fields such as `account_number`, `account_holder`, `balance`, etc.
- **Transaction**: Represents a transaction with fields such as `transaction_id`, `account`, `amount`, `transaction_type`, etc. Each transaction is linked to an account, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
- **Customer**: Represents a customer with fields such as `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `password`, etc. Each customer can have multiple accounts, establishing a one-to-many relationship.

### Views/Viewsets and Their Roles

- **AccountViewSet**: Handles CRUD operations for accounts. It includes methods for listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting accounts.
- **TransactionViewSet**: Handles CRUD operations for transactions. It includes methods for listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting transactions.
- **CustomerViewSet**: Handles CRUD operations for customers. It includes methods for listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting customers.

### Serializers and Validation Rules

- **AccountSerializer**: Serializes account data and includes validation rules for fields such as `account_number` and `balance`.
- **TransactionSerializer**: Serializes transaction data and includes validation rules for fields such as `amount` and `transaction_type`.
- **CustomerSerializer**: Serializes customer data and includes validation rules for fields such as `email` and `password`.

### URL Patterns and Their Purpose

- **/accounts/**: Endpoint for listing and creating accounts.
- **/accounts/{id}/**: Endpoint for retrieving, updating, and deleting a specific account.
- **/transactions/**: Endpoint for listing and creating transactions.
- **/transactions/{id}/**: Endpoint for retrieving, updating, and deleting a specific transaction.
- **/customers/**: Endpoint for listing and creating customers.
- **/customers/{id}/**: Endpoint for retrieving, updating, and deleting a specific customer.

These URL patterns map to the corresponding viewsets, enabling the API to handle requests for account, transaction, and customer operations.
